        <h1>Hello World, my name is Reagan Davenport!</h1>
        <p>I was born on December 30th.</p>
        <p>My favorite color is purple.</p>

        <h2>My <em>many</em> dogs.</h2>
        <p>The first dog my family ever had was a Doberman Pincher named Dash. He was a good boy. 
            The second one was Weimerweiner named Sterling. He was not as good of a boy.
            The first Great Dane we ever had was a black Dane named, Maxie. She was highly strung, but a good girl. 
            The next Dane was a Mantle called Fletcher, he's good as gold.
            Artemis came next, another Mantle. He's a mess.  
            Finally, we have Misha... he's <em>A LOT.</em> I have more pictures of my dogs than I do of my entire family.

        <h2>Hobbies, Interests, and Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>
            I have many hobbies. I cook, knit, game. I can make fried rice, rice pudding, tetziki sauce (a Greek yogurt sause), Japanese cucumber salad, among other things.
             I dabble in entymology and botany. I have read way too many Chinese web novels. My favorite novel is "The Count of Monte Cristo".
            I will go on a full on rant on History, mostly Chinese and European (American History is stupid). 
            I have written a 20 page paper on Chinese propaganda posters from the Cultural Revolution, and I had to cut information, no joke.
            Recently, I've developed an interest in gardening, however Nature and I are not of speaking terms.
            When Nature stops having so many flying insects and spiders, I may become a gardener, but not before.
            I speak only a little Greek and a bit more Mandarin Chinese. (I had text here in Greek and Chinese, but the browser freaked out.)
            No one has ever guessed my middle name (hint: it begins with A and has a Greek origin).
